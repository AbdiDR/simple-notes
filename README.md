This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.0.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Angular CLI** (v17 or higher)

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/AbdiDR/simple-notes.git>
   cd simple-notes
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

## 🎯 Application Features

- ✅ **Create Notes** - Add new notes with title and content

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
